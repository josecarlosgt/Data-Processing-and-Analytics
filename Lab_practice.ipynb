    "In this lab, you will practice fundamental concepts of programming in Python covered previously in tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning objectives:\n",
    "- Practice the use of scalar types and string formatting in Python\n",
    "- Practice control flow structures in Python, including conditionals and iteration statements\n",
    "- Work with time data in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some helpful notes:\n",
    "- This lab practice should take about two hours to complete.\n",
    "If a problem takes you too long to solve, don't hesitate to ask your instructor in class or post your questions in Canvas.\n",
    "- Do not try to solve the problems by copy&pasting solutions from other sources. Engaging in this kind of practice may lead you to finish this lab faster, but it won't contribute to your learning and improving your problem-solving skills. \n",
    "- When browsing for examples about Python's utilities and features, try to understand the logic and purpose of the functionality you incorporate in your solutions.\n",
    "- Make sure you review the examples covered in the tutorials before attempting this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "> When using general-purpose programming languages like Python, it is common to rely on external sources of documentation to solve specific problems. In this lab practice, you will use references to Python's official documentation site and other sites to learn more about string interpolation in Python (f-strings) and how to work with dates and times."
