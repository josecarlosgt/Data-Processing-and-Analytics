The construction of pipelines simplifies the identification and implementation of the different operations required to analyze a dataset. \n",

    "- This lab practice should take about two hours to complete. If a problem takes you too long to solve, don't hesitate to ask your instructor in class or post your questions in Canvas.\n",
